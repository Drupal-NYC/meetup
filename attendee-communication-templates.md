### Attendee Check-in Instructions for 30 Rock monthly meetup

_The following is the email sent out via meetup attendee messaging to attendees, detailing the check-in process. This email is sent by noon on the day of the meetup:_

**Subject:** Instructions for checking-in tonight

**Body:**

Greetings,

You are confirmed for the Drupal NYC Meetup at 30 Rock tonight at 6:00pm. You are on the building security list, you must bring a photo ID so you will be allowed entrance to the building and so we can issue you a name badge to exit and re-enter.

NBCUniversal Technology is sponsoring pizza and beverages which will be served starting at 6pm so please get there early if you would like to partake.

==============

**Check-in instructions \(6:00-7:30pm\)**

Check-in officially starts at 6:00pm and will end at 7:30pm. Please take a look at this [check-in video](http://bit.ly/dnyccheckin) for location of NBC Guest Reception.

Enter at the 50th street \(between 5th and 6th Avenues\) entrance under the neon sign that says Rainbow Room/Observatory Deck. Then turn right & down the corridor on your left look for "NBC Guest Reception". You must bring your photo ID. Your photo will be taken by building security. You must be okay with this to attend.

Here is a map of where to enter Rockefeller Center to get to the Rainbow Observation Deck Entrance, [https://goo.gl/maps/8VHisG5Pej82](https://goo.gl/maps/8VHisG5Pej82).

After getting a name badge using the instructions above, youâ€™ll then be escorted to the event in11A by the infamous [NBC Page Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Parcell).

Late check-in instructions \(7:30-8:30pm\)

If you arrive later than 7:30, there will be no page escorts but you can still follow the check-in instructions above and security will tell you how to get to 11A.

==========

See you then,

\[Your name\]
