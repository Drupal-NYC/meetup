# Drupal NYC Meetup Content

This document intends to cover what and how content is provided for participants in the Drupal NYC community.

We hold three events a month:

* A formal speaker and presentations meetup at [30 Rock](https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=30+Rockefeller+Center,+New+York,+NY,+10112,+us) on a weeknight
* A informal social gathering at a restaurant or bar on a weeknight \(called Drupal After Work; formally know as Drupal Happy Hour\)
* A informal collaborative and working day-long session on a weekend \(called Drupal Playday\)

All of our events are organized using Meetup.com at [https://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/](https://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/). You can read more about our use of Meetup.com at _\[a forthcoming documentation page\]_. **Photo ID** is required for the formal presentations meetup at 30 Rock. Sometimes a photo id is required \(dependent on the venue, e.g., bar, office, etc\) for Drupal After Work.

## Presentations at 30 Rock

We hold a presentation-format meetup at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the evening on the **first Wednesday** of every month that entails several speakers presenting on various topics to an audience.

**Where and how the meetup is run:**

* Typically held in room 11A of 30 Rock \(when that room is booked, then our fallback room is the Talent Lab\)
* Meetups held in room 11A are typically recorded, and the room is setup accordingly. When using the Talent Lab, there's no option for recording.
* Begins at 6:30pm with general announcements, followed by talks, and concludes with an invitation for attendees to move to nearby bar \(typically [Bill’s Bar & Burger](https://goo.gl/maps/Eghs2) \(1 block north, 16 W. 51st St., accessible via Rockefeller Concourse\)

**Format of presentations:**

* Usually a couple short, high-level "lightning" talks followed by one or two longer, in-depth talks
* The lightning talks are typically 10 mins long



#### Attendee Check-in Process

The following is the email sent out to attendees the day of the meetup, detailing the check-in process:

**Check-in instructions \(6:00-7:30pm\)**

Check-in officially starts at 6:00pm and will end at 7:30pm. Please take a look at this [check-invideo](http://bit.ly/dnyccheckin) for location of NBC Guest Reception.

Enter at the 50th street \(between 5th and 6th Avenues\) entrance under the neon sign that says Rainbow Room/Observatory Deck. Then turn right & down the corridor on your left look for "NBC Guest Reception". You must bring your photo ID. Your photo will be taken by building security. You must be okay with this to attend.

Here is a map of where to enter Rockefeller Center to get to the Rainbow Observation Deck Entrance, [https://goo.gl/maps/8VHisG5Pej82](https://goo.gl/maps/8VHisG5Pej82).

After getting a name badge using the instructions above, you’ll then be escorted to the event in11A by the infamous [NBC Page Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Parcell).

Late check-in instructions \(7:30-8:30pm\)

If you arrive later than 7:30, there will be no page escorts but you can still follow the check-in instructions above and security will tell you how to get to 11A.

### How speakers are selected and coordinated

* Presentation submissions are made in person at meetups, via Google Form, or email
* Speaker and presentation topics are coordinated via a Google Spreadsheet
* Speaker selection is made by the organizing team on Slack
* Presentation titles, description, and speaker bios are received from speakers, coordinated via a Google Doc and entered into the Meetup.com event description
