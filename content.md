# Drupal NYC Meetup Content

This document intends to cover what and how content is provided for participants in the Drupal NYC community.

We hold three events a month:

* A formal speaker and presentations meetup at 30 Rock on a weeknight
* A informal social gathering at a restaurant or bar on a weeknight
* A informal collaborative and working day-long session on a weekend

All of our events are organized using Meetup.com at https://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/. You can read more about our use of Meetup.com at _\[a forthcoming documentation page\]_.
