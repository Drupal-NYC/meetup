# Drupal NYC Meetup Content

This document intends to cover what and how content is provided for participants in the Drupal NYC community.

We hold three events a month:

* A [formal speaker and presentations meetup](https://drupal-nyc.gitbooks.io/meetup/content/presentations-at-30-rock.html) at [30 Rock](https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=30+Rockefeller+Center,+New+York,+NY,+10112,+us) on generally the **1st Wednesday of the month**
* A informal social gathering at a restaurant or bar on a weeknight \(called Drupal After Work; formally know as Drupal Happy Hour\)
* An [informal collaborative and working day-long session](https://drupal-nyc.gitbooks.io/meetup/content/drupal-playday.html) on generally the **3rd Saturday of the month** \(called Drupal Playday\)

All of our events are organized using Meetup.com at [https://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/](https://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/). 

You can read more about our use of Meetup.com at _\[a forthcoming documentation page\]_. **Photo ID** is required for the formal presentations meetup at 30 Rock. Sometimes a photo id is required \(dependent on the venue, e.g., bar, office, etc\) for Drupal After Work.
