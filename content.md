# Drupal NYC Meetup Content

This document intends to cover what and how content is provided for participants in the Drupal NYC community.

We hold three events a month:

* A formal speaker and presentations meetup at [30 Rock](https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=30+Rockefeller+Center,+New+York,+NY,+10112,+us) on a weeknight
* A informal social gathering at a restaurant or bar on a weeknight \(called Drupal After Work; formally know as Drupal Happy Hour\)
* A informal collaborative and working day-long session on a weekend \(called Drupal Playday\)

All of our events are organized using Meetup.com at [https://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/](https://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/). You can read more about our use of Meetup.com at _\[a forthcoming documentation page\]_. **Photo ID** is required for the formal presentations meetup at 30 Rock. Sometimes a photo id is required \(dependent on the venue, e.g., bar, office, etc\) for Drupal After Work.

## Presentations at 30 Rock

We hold a presentation-format meetup at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the evening on the **first Wednesday** of every month that entails several speakers presenting on various topics to an audience.

**Where and how the meetup is run:**

* Typically held in room 11A of 30 Rock \(when that room is booked, then our fallback room is the Talent Lab\)
* Meetups held in room 11A are typically recorded, and the room is setup accordingly. When using the Talent Lab, there's no option for recording.
* Begins at 6:30pm with general announcements, followed by talks, and concludes with an invitation for attendees to move to nearby bar \(typically [Billâ€™s Bar & Burger](https://goo.gl/maps/Eghs2) \(1 block north, 16 W. 51st St., accessible via Rockefeller Concourse\)

**Format of presentations:**

* Usually a couple short, high-level "lightning" talks followed by one or two longer, in-depth talks
* The lightning talks are typically 10 mins long

#### Attendee Check-in Process

* Check-in happens between 6-7:30pm. Attendees check-in at NBC Guest Reception \(see [check-in video](http://bit.ly/dnyccheckin) for location\)
* Photo ID is necessary
* The check-in process also involves the attendees photo being taken prior to being given a guest badge
* After receiving the guest badge, attendees are escorted to the event by NBC Pages
* Late check-in \(unescorted\) is possible after 7:30pm

More detailed check-in instructions can be found on the [check-in attendee message template](../meetup/content/attendee-communication-templates.md#check-in-instructions).

### How speakers are selected and coordinated

* Presentation submissions are made in person at meetups, via Google Form, or email
* Speaker and presentation topics are coordinated via a Google Spreadsheet
* Speaker selection is made by the organizing team on Slack
* Presentation titles, description, and speaker bios are received from speakers, coordinated via a Google Doc and entered into the Meetup.com event description
