# Drupal After Work

This is previously know as Drupal Happy Hour, part of Drupal World Wide Happy Hour initiative, and it still is.

Right now Drupal After Work comes in two different formats:

1. At a bar where people talk over drinks and food.
2. Board game night, where we'll meet at an office space over board games, snacks and drinks.

For option #2, DPCI have been graciously hosting us for May and June of 2017. 

Suggestions for hosting space as follows:

1. Avoid hosting space that needs to cut a lot of red tape and requires a lot of overhead to run the Meetup. E.g. Some institutional buildings requires paperwork and charges to cover overtime for security and maintainence workers, which generates a lot of overhead costs.
2. Please get in touch with potential hosts at least 3 weeks in advance.
3. Unless reimbursements are provided, please provided food, drinks and games to the Meetup. It should not be the hosts' sole responsibility to provide such amenities.
