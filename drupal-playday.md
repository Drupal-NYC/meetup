# Drupal Playday

We hold a an informal open open office hours type of event. Typically the event is held on the **3rd Saturday of the month** from 11am - 4pm.

**Where and how the meetup is run:**

* Typically held either @ [DPCI](https://goo.gl/maps/vrycabxuLuD2) or @ [DoSomething.org](https://goo.gl/maps/iARTsw74TkJ2)
* Typically attendees fall into at least one of the following categories: 
    * Coming to the event prepared with something to work on
    * Coming to the event to network/socialize
    * Drupal newbie looking to connect and ask questions
    * Coming to the event with a specific question/issue
* Attendees arrive in staggered fashion between the allotted period
* If there's budget, snacks or lunch may be provided
* Expect ~ 40% turnout of the RSVPs

## Attendee Check-in Process

* Typically check-in is not necessary
* If hosted at DPCI, then photo ID is necessary

## Some Tips for Creating a Welcoming Environment

* If hosting, introduce yourself to each attendee as they arrive and ask what they are working on / if they have any questions
* If you're unable to assist the attendee yourself, help facilitate mentoring by introducing the question to others in the room _(people tend not to ask a whole room of strangers for help)_
* If the list of attendees includes a number of folks who are new to the event, try to see if regulars can attend 
* Try to break for lunch together so it's more inviting to newcomers
