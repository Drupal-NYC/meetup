# Presentations at 30 Rock

We hold a presentation-format meetup at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the evening on the **first Wednesday** of every month that entails several speakers presenting on various topics to an audience.

**Where and how the meetup is run:**

* Typically held in room 11A of 30 Rock \(when that room is booked, then our fallback room is the Talent Lab\)
* Meetups held in room 11A are typically recorded, and the room is setup accordingly. When using the Talent Lab, there's no option for recording.
* Begins at 6:30pm with general announcements, followed by talks, and concludes with an invitation for attendees to move to nearby bar \(typically [Billâ€™s Bar & Burger](https://goo.gl/maps/Eghs2) \(1 block north, 16 W. 51st St., accessible via Rockefeller Concourse\)

**Format of presentations:**

* Usually a couple short, high-level "lightning" talks followed by one or two longer, in-depth talks
* The lightning talks are typically 10 mins long

## Attendee Check-in Process

* Check-in happens between 6-7:30pm. Attendees check-in at NBC Guest Reception \(see [check-in video](http://bit.ly/dnyccheckin) for location\)
* Photo ID is necessary
* The check-in process also involves the attendees photo being taken prior to being given a guest badge
* After receiving the guest badge, attendees are escorted to the event by NBC Pages
* Late check-in \(unescorted\) is possible after 7:30pm

More detailed check-in instructions can be found on the [check-in attendee message template](https://drupal-nyc.gitbooks.io/meetup/content/attendee-communication-templates.html#check-in-instructions).

## How speakers are selected and coordinated

* Presentation submissions are made in person at meetups, via Google Form, or email
* Speaker and presentation topics are coordinated via a Google Spreadsheet titled **"DrupalNYC meetup speakers"** (pinned in the #organizering channel in Slack). Once you have a potential speaker, please enter the information into this spreadsheet.
* Speaker selection is made by the organizing team on Slack
* Presentation titles, description, and speaker bios are received from speakers, coordinated via a Google Doc and entered into the Meetup.com event description
