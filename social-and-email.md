* A '#Meetup' hashtag is used for announcements specific to meetups.

Content moderation is stable in Drupal 8.5.x. by Eric Sod

The Content Moderation module allows you to expand on Drupal's "unpublished" and "published" states for content. It allows you to have a published version that is live, but have a separate working copy that is undergoing review before it is published. This is achieved by using Workflows to apply different states and transitions to entities as needed.

We'll talk about how content moderation in core came about, look at examples, and discuss what's still to come, including the Workspaces module. The Workspaces module has been released as an experimental module in Drupal 8.6.x.

The content moderation configuration we will be discussing is available on GitHub (https://github.com/esod/content_moderation_configuration/tree/develop). There are instructions on how to apply the configuration in the README (https://github.com/esod/content_moderation_configuration/blob/develop/README.md).

## Recommended Toolset

### bit.ly
A bit.ly account is attached to @DrupalNYC Twitter account. Bit.ly will ask you for Twitter credentials.

You have the option to customize the bit.ly link at creation time and any time after. The usual bit.ly link format for monthly Meetup is `dnyc` (Drupal NYC), followed by two digit month (e.g. `07`) and two digit year (e.g. `18`).

### Boomerang for Gmail
Boomerang is an extension for Gmail that helps scheduling e-mails to be sent at a later date and time.

Recommended times for e-mail scheduling is 9AM during weekdays. The logic is to have the message showing up relatively to user's most recently received messages.

### Tweetdeck for Twitter
Tweetdeck is also a scheduling tool for Twitter. Tweetdeck login can either be done via @DrupalNYC Twitter account directly, or if a member is assigned privileges to access @DrupalNYC account, the member can login via his or her own Twitter account.
