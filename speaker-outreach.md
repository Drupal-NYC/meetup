### Request to speak

Hi  *[enter their name here ;)]*, 

My name is  *[enter your name]*, I'm a coorganizer of the NYC Drupal meetup and I'm writing to see if you'd be interested in presenting at one of our meetups? *[maybe say something about why you think they should present]*,

*[or if a seeking a specific date for them to present make it clear here]*,

*[this section is all about the format and logistics of the meetup]*
Our meetups are the first Wednesday of every month in a fabulous space at 30 Rockefeller Center. We record the screen and audio, provide pizza and soft drinks, and usually have around 60 or so people in attendance. Check out some of our recent events and upcoming ones at http://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/.

Please let me know your interest, thanks!

### Confirmation of speaking & request for materials

Excellent, thanks so much for being interested in presenting to our group!

Just a couple things I need from you first, will you please send me a title to list for your talk as well as a single paragraph description of what you'll talk abotut and a single paragraph bio about yourself? We'll list this details on our meetup.com page and in an upcoming email to our members. Feel free to include any contact information too.

And lastly, please join our meetup group and RSVP for the event http://www.meetup.com/drupalnyc/ because building security requires attendee names for acess.

Thanks, and let me know any questions!
